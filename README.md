# The YaST Ruby Testing Image

[![CI](https://github.com/yast/ci-ruby-container/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/yast/ci-ruby-container/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This git repository contains the configuration used to build the docker
image used for [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).
The resulting docker image is available at https://registry.opensuse.org/.

## Automatic Rebuilds

- The image is rebuilt whenever a commit it pushed to the `master` branch.
- The [yast-ci-ruby-container-master](
  https://ci.opensuse.org/view/Yast/job/yast-ci-ruby-container-master/)
  Jenkins job copies the configuration to the OBS project
- The OBS tracks the dependencies and rebuilds the image if any dependant package
  is updated.

## Triggering a Rebuild Manually

If for some reason the automatic rebuild do not work or it failed you can
trigger the rebuild in the OBS just like for the other regular packages.


## The Image Content

This image is based on the latest openSUSE Tumbleweed image, additionally
it contains the packages needed for running the tests for YaST packages written
in Ruby. It is possible to install additional packagers if needed, see the
[Examples](#examples) section below.

## Using the Image in the Other Projects

The image contains the `yast-travis-ruby` script which runs all the checks and tests.

The workflow is:

- Copy the sources into the `/usr/src/app` directory.
- If the code needs additional packages install them using the `zypper install`
  command from the local `Dockerfile`. If the package can be used by more modules
  you can add it into the base Docker image here.
- Run the `yast-travis-ruby` script. (Optionally you can use the `-x` and `-o`
  options to split the work into several smaller tasks and run them in parallel,
  see the [yast2-storage-ng example](
  https://github.com/yast/yast-storage-ng/blob/master/.travis.yml).)

## Examples

### `Dockerfile` example

```Dockerfile
FROM registry.opensuse.org/yast/head/containers/yast-ruby

# optionally install additional packages if needed:
# RUN zypper --non-interactive install --no-recommends \
#  libxml2-devel \
#  yast2-core-devel

# copy the sources into the image
COPY . /usr/src/app
```

### `.travis.yml` Example

```yaml
sudo: required
language: bash
services:
  - docker

before_install:
  - docker build -t yast-foo-image .
  # list the installed packages (just for easier debugging)
  - docker run --rm -it yast-foo-image rpm -qa | sort

script:
  # the "yast-travis-ruby" script is included in the base yast-ruby image
  # see https://github.com/yast/ci-ruby-container/blob/master/package/yast-travis-ruby
  - docker run -it --rm -e TRAVIS=1 -e TRAVIS_JOB_ID="$TRAVIS_JOB_ID" yast-foo-image yast-travis-ruby
```

(Replace `foo` with your package name to avoid collisions with the other packages
when running the same commands locally.)


## Building the Image Locally

### Using the OSC Tool

From the Git sources:

```sh
# you need the rubygem-yast-rake package installed
rake osc:build
```

From the OBS checkout:

```sh
# check it out if not already present
osc co YaST:Head/ci-ruby-container
cd YaST:Head/ci-ruby-container

# build it
osc build containers
```

### Using the Docker tool

️:warning: This approach is not 100% the same as building the image with `osc` described above.
The `osc` build injects some special modifications to allow building the image inside
the OBS build environment.

:information_source:️ You should prefer using the `osc` method if possible, use the `docker`
build only as a fallback when the `osc` build is not possible or does not work in your environment.

```sh
docker build -t ci-ruby-container-test -f package/Dockerfile package/
```
