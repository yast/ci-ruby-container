This git repository contains the configuration used to build the docker
image used for TravisCI.

The Jenkins job
https://ci.opensuse.org/view/Yast/job/yast-ci-ruby-container-master/
copies to configuration to the OBS project
https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/YaST:Head/ci-ruby-container. The
resulting docker image is available at https://registry.opensuse.org/.
